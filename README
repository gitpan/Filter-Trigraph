0.02: Due to popular demand, Filter::Trigraph no longer requires v5.6.

NAME

    Filter::Trigraph - understand ANSI C trigraphs in Perl source.

SYNOPSIS

      use Filter::Trigraph;

      my $x = shift??!??!"testing";
      if($ENV??<BIGVOWELS??>)??<
        ??= uppercase all vowels in $x
        $x=??-s/(??(aeiou??))/??/u$1/g;
      ??>else??<
        ??= uppercase all non-vowels in $x
        $x=??-s/(??(??'aeiou??))/??/u$1/g;
      ??>
      $??!=1;
      print "$x??/n";

DESCRIPTION

    Now that Perl supports Unicode, we should also support ISO 646-1983.

    ISO 646 is a character set very like ASCII, but with 9 of you favourite
    characters removed.

    ANSI C supports this limited character set using a wonderful system called
    "trigraphs" that replace the 9 missing essential characters with sequences
    of two question marks and another symbol.

    Using this module you can now write Perl using only the characters found in
    ISO 646.
